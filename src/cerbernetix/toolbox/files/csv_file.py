    The class binds a filename with a set of properties so that it can be opened in a consistent
    way.

    The read API does not allow to size the data to read. However, it reads the file row by row.

    Attributes:
        filename (str): The path to the file to manage.
        binary (bool): The type of file, say text. It must always be False.
        encoding (str, optional): The file encoding.
        dialect (str, optional): The CSV dialect to use. If 'auto' is given, the reader will try
        detecting the CSV dialect by reading a sample at the head of the file.

    Examples:
    ```python
    from cerbernetix.toolbox.files import CSVFile

    file = CSVFile("path/to/the/file", dialect='excel', encoding="UTF-8")

        Args:
            filename (str): The path to the file to manage.
            create (bool, optional): Expect to create the file. If it exists, it will be replaced.
            Defaults to False.
            append (bool, optional): Expect to extend the file. Data will be added at the end.

            read (bool, optional): Expect to also read the file.
            Defaults to False.
            write (bool, optional): Expect to also write to the file.

            try detecting the CSV dialect by reading a sample at the head of the file.
            Defaults to CSV_DIALECT.
            delimiter (str, optional): A one-character string used to separate fields.
            Defaults to ",".
            doublequote (bool, optional): Controls how instances of quotechar appearing inside a
            field should themselves be quoted. When True, the character is doubled. When False, the
            escapechar is used as a prefix to the quotechar. Defaults to True.
            escapechar (str, optional):  A one-character string used by the writer to escape the
            delimiter if quoting is set to QUOTE_NONE and the quotechar if doublequote is False.
            On reading, the escapechar removes any special meaning from the following character.
            Defaults to None, which disables escaping.
            lineterminator (str, optional): The string used to terminate lines produced by the
            writer. Defaults to "\r\n".
            quotechar (str, optional): A one-character string used to quote fields containing
            special characters, such as the delimiter or quotechar, or which contain new-line
            characters. Defaults to '"'.
            quoting (bool, optional): Controls when quotes should be be generated by the writer,
            or recognized by the reader. It can take on any of the QUOTE_* constants.
            Defaults to QUOTE_MINIMAL.
            skipinitialspace (bool, optional): When True, spaces immediately following the
            delimiter are ignored. The default is False.
            strict (bool, optional):  When True, raise exception Error on bad CSV input.
            Defaults to False.
            fieldnames (sequence, optional): The name of each column in the CSV. Depending on the
            access mode, the manner how fieldnames is consumed differs.

            When reading, if fieldnames is omitted, the values in the first row of the file will be
            used as the fieldnames. Regardless of how the fieldnames are determined, the dictionary
            preserves their original ordering.

            If a row has more fields than fieldnames, the remaining data is put in a list and stored
            with the fieldname specified by restkey (which defaults to None). If a non-blank row has
            fewer fields than fieldnames, the missing values are filled-in with the value of restval
            (which defaults to None).

            For reading headless CSV, set fieldnames to False.

            When writing, if fieldnames is omitted and the first row is a dictionary, its keys will
            be used as fieldnames. Every subsequent row will need to be dictionaries as well. If the
            first row is a sequence, no header will be added, and all subsequent row will need to be
            sequences as well.

            The fieldnames sequence identify the order in which values from the rows are written to
            the file. The optional restval parameter specifies the value to be written if the
            dictionary is missing a key in fieldnames. If the current row contains a key not found
            in fieldnames, the optional extrasaction parameter indicates what action to take. If it
            is set to 'raise', the default value, a ValueError is raised. If it is set to 'ignore',
            extra values in the row are ignored. Any other optional or keyword arguments are passed
            to the underlying writer instance.

        ```python

        strict (bool, optional):  When True, raise exception Error on bad CSV input.
        Defaults to False.
        fieldnames (sequence, optional): The name of each column in the CSV. If fieldnames is
        omitted and the first row is a dictionary, its keys will be used as fieldnames. Every
        subsequent row will need to be dictionaries as well. If the first row is a sequence, no
        header will be added, and all subsequent row will need to be sequences as well.

        The fieldnames sequence identify the order in which values from the rows are written to
        the file. The optional restval parameter specifies the value to be written if the
        dictionary is missing a key in fieldnames. If the current row contains a key not found
        in fieldnames, the optional extrasaction parameter indicates what action to take. If it
        is set to 'raise', the default value, a ValueError is raised. If it is set to 'ignore',
        extra values in the row are ignored. Any other optional or keyword arguments are passed
        to the underlying writer instance.

    Raises:
        OSError: If the file cannot be written.

    Returns:
        int: The number of bytes written to the file.

    ```python

    """Reads a CSV content from a Zip.

    The returned value can be either a list (default) or an iterator (when the iterator parameter
    is True).

    Args:
        buffer (bytes): A buffer of bytes representing the zipped content.
        filename (str, optional): The name of the file to extract from the zip If omitted, the first
        file having a '.csv' extension will be selected. Defaults to None.
        encoding (str, optional): The file encoding. Defaults to CSV_ENCODING.
        decoding_errors (str, optional): Controls how decoding errors are handled. If 'strict', a
        UnicodeError exception is raised. Other possible values are 'ignore', 'replace', and any
        other name registered via codecs.register_error(). See Error Handlers for details.
        Defaults to "ignore".
        dialect (str, optional): The CSV dialect to use. If 'auto' is given, the reader will
        try detecting the CSV dialect by reading a sample at the head of the file.
        Defaults to CSV_DIALECT.
        iterator (bool, optional): When True, the function will return an iterator instead of a
        list. Defaults to False.
        delimiter (str, optional): A one-character string used to separate fields.
        Defaults to ','.
        doublequote (bool, optional): Controls how instances of quotechar appearing inside a
        field should themselves be quoted. When True, the character is doubled. When False, the
        escapechar is used as a prefix to the quotechar. Defaults to True.
        escapechar (str, optional):  A one-character string used to removes any special meaning
        from the following character. Defaults to None, which disables escaping.
        quotechar (str, optional): A one-character string used to quote fields containing
        special characters, such as the delimiter or quotechar, or which contain new-line
        characters. Defaults to '"'.
        quoting (bool, optional): Controls when quotes should be be recognized by the reader.
        It can take on any of the QUOTE_* constants. Defaults to QUOTE_MINIMAL.
        skipinitialspace (bool, optional): When True, spaces immediately following the
        delimiter are ignored. The default is False.
        strict (bool, optional):  When True, raise exception Error on bad CSV input.
        Defaults to False.
        fieldnames (sequence, optional): The name of each column in the CSV. If fieldnames is
        omitted, the values in the first row of the file will be used as the fieldnames. Regardless
        of how the fieldnames are determined, the dictionary preserves their original ordering.
        If a row has more fields than fieldnames, the remaining data is put in a list and stored
        with the fieldname specified by restkey (which defaults to None). If a non-blank row has
        fewer fields than fieldnames, the missing values are filled-in with the value of restval
        (which defaults to None).

        For reading headless CSV, set fieldnames to False.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the file does not exist.

    Returns:
        Iterable[dict | list]: The data read from the CSV file.
