class FileManager:
    """Offers a simple API for reading and writing files.

    The class binds a filename with a set of properties so that it can be opened in a consistent
    way.

    The read API does not allow to size the data to read. The FileManager reads all the content.
    However, it comes better with the specialized child classes, which can read chunks of the file
    based on a specific format. See CSVFile, JSONFile, or PickleFile for more information.

    Attributes:
        filename (str): The path to the file to manage.
        binary (bool): The type of file: binary (True) or text (False).
        encoding (str, optional): The file encoding, only needed for text files.

    Examples:
    ```python
    from cerbernetix.toolbox.files import FileManager

    file = FileManager("path/to/the/file", binary=False, encoding="UTF-8")

    # open the file, then read its content
